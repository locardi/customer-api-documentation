# Locardi Customer API Documentation

This is the documentation for interacting with our APIs.

## SDKs

At this stage we provide our own SDK for the following languages:

- PHP https://github.com/locardi/php-sdk

The SDKs take care of all of the authentication logic, but, if you prefer, you can write your own following the documentation below. 

## Endpoint

All the relative API URLs listed in the following pages must point to the following endpoint:

https://collector.locardiapp.com

## JWT API

The Locardi API implements a JSON Web Token authentication system.

In order to send requests you first need to retrieve a token.

This API is for retrieving a token.

### Request

```
POST /jwt/token
Body:
{
    "_username": "theusername",
    "_password": "thepassword"
}
```

### Response

If the login is successful:

```
Status Code: 200
Body:
{
    "success": true,
    "token":"the-actual-token"
}
```

Otherwise:

```
Status Code: 400 if Bad request (the JSON body you have sent is wrong or 500 if Internal error (please contact us for support)
Body:
{
    "success": false,
    "error": "The error message"
}
```

The token will be valid for 1 hour (60 minutes), after that you will need to apply for a new one with the same process.

You will receive a 401 HTTP status code from an API if you use an expired or invalid token.
 
We recommend to store the token somewhere (in a file or in the session or in a cache) and apply for a new one only in when getting a 401.

### Sending the token when calling an API

The token has to be provided as a request header attribute as follows:

```
Headers:
X-Access-Token: the-token
Content-Type: application/json
```

If the token is not provided or incorrect, you will get a 401 response with this JSON content:

```json
{
    "message": "A Token was not found in the TokenStorage."
}
```

If the token was correct you will get the JSON response for the specific API you called.

## Request API

This API is for sending a new request to the locardi database.

### Request

```
POST /collector/request
```

Headers:

```
X-Access-Token: the-token
Content-Type: application/json
```

Body:

```json

If you will ever provide a new name for a user or an organization using the same ID this will result in overriding the user or organization name and NOT in creating a new user/organization.

### Response

Status Codes:

```
201 if successful
400 if Bad request
500 if Internal error
```

The response body is just an empty JSON `[]`

## Failed Login for Unknown Username API

You may want to trace requests where somebody is trying to login with a username/email that you donâ€™t have in the database. In some situations this is the scenario when somebody is trying a brute force attack.
